## Abstract

R serves as an excellent open source platform to perform various spatial analysis. With recent developments in packages which can handle large datasets in very little time like sf and terra, spatial data wrangling and modeling has also become simple. In this tutorial we will introduce basic spatial packages like sf, raster,that are extensions of tidyverse. 

## Outline

Introduce spatial data, data types, formats   
Projection systems   
Packages available and downloading data   
Handling and transforming data   
Extracting useful information   
Map making (static and interactive)   
Other resources   
Q and A

## Audience

This tutorial is aimed for R users who are new to spatial analysis. Prerequisites - Familiarity with basic data wrangling in R (tidyverse, etc). People who use R for plotting, summary statistics and would like to use R for spatial analysis and mapping. People who have used other spatial analysis tools like QGIS will also find the tutorial useful on
how to do similar analyses in R.
